# Palia-Item-Data
Gathering information on resources and items on Palia. This is mainly a learning project for me to explore machine learning.

## Screencap
Custom screen capture for getting data.

### Reasons for this approach:
- I only need a couple of frames to get the data needed.
- Easy to modify later for image/video manipulation on the fly.
- It was good experience for me.
